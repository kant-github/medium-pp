# Medium-like Project (Incomplete)

This is a sample project designed to explore serverless architecture using Hono for backend deployment. The project is inspired by Medium, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and share their stories.

## Project Overview

### Technologies Used

- **Hono:** A minimal and fast web framework for the Edge, used as the backend for this project.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Backend deployed on serverless platforms, providing scalability and ease of deployment.

### Why Hono?

I chose Hono because its syntax is cleaner and more straightforward compared to Cloudflare Workers. It simplifies the development process while still leveraging the benefits of serverless deployment.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and sign in to the platform.
- **Story Sharing:** Authenticated users can share their stories.

### Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently incomplete and serves as an experimental exploration of serverless architecture with Hono.
